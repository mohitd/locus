## Coding Standards
Take a look at the [Android Code Style Guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) for the general coding style. There will soon be a settings.jar file that will contain the recommended code settings (i.e. curly braces on the same line, one space between statements and the parentheses). You can import the settings.jar file via File->Import Settings. 

## Git-flow
For this project, we'll be using [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). You can download and install git-flow [here](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). The gist (no pun intended) of it is shown in the image below:
